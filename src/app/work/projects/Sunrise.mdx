## Project Overview

Development of Sunrise - a comprehensive cruise and travel booking platform for seamless management of cruise reservations and travel packages.  
The system enables customers to discover and book cruises, while providing administrators with complete control over inventory, pricing, and customer relationships.

## Key Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure role-based system (Administrator, Agent, Customer) with JWT token management
- **Cruise Management**: Complete cruise lifecycle with itinerary planning, cabin configuration, and availability tracking
- **Booking System**: End-to-end reservation process from search to payment confirmation
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing with multiple payment methods and transaction tracking
- **Administration Panel**: Sunrise Dashboard with booking analytics, revenue reports, and inventory management
- **Rating System**: Service evaluation by customers after completed voyages
- **Multi-language Support**: Full support for Spanish and English interfaces

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite build tool, HeroUI for component library
- **Backend**: Laravel 11+ with PHP 8.2+, JWT authentication
- **Database**: MySQL with Eloquent ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion animations
- **PDF Generation**: Laravel DomPDF for booking confirmations and invoices
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Architecture and Technical Challenges

The Sunrise system was designed following a modern layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: Reusable React components with custom hooks for state management
- **Business Logic Layer**: Laravel services and controllers for booking logic and payment processing
- **Data Layer**: Eloquent ORM with optimized relationships and query performance

**Main challenges overcome in Sunrise:**

- Implementation of real-time cabin availability synchronization across multiple booking sessions
